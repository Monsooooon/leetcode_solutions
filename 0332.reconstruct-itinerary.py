#
# Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival
# airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets
# belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with
# JFK.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that
# has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the
# itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
# All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
# You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
# One must use all the tickets once and only once.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
# Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
# Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
# Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is
# ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
# But it is larger in lexical order.
